Card Game - Blackjack

Introduction

This project is an attempt to build a fun game of blackjack from scratch. 
Blackjack is played against the casino so the main objective is to have a total hand value that exceeds the total hand 
value of the dealer without going over a total point value of 21.
A traditional 52 cards deck is used (or several decks) and each card has a point value attached to it.

Language:
